YmsGradientView

iOS UIView subclass featuring plist configured bitmap-free gradients.

QUICKSTART: 

* Copy YmsGradientView.[hm] and YmsGradientView.plist to 
  your project.
* Instantiate a UIView in Interface Builder. With the identity inspector, 
  set the custom class to YmsGradientView.
* Configure the gradient using the file YmsGradientView.plist.
  The settings map to the properties defined in CAGradientLayer.
* You can subclass YmsGradientView and create a plist with the subclass
  name to create your own custom view.
* YmsGradientView can also be instantiated programmatically.

NOTES:
* This code is written using ARC. 

Please read the project wiki on GitHub for more information.
